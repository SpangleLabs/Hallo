split help up into different functions, so 'help commands' lists categories of commands (by module?) then 'help commands all' lists them all, while 'help commands {module}' lists commnds in a module

make config_view a bit neater perhaps? manually, rather than prettyprint. perhaps include a flag to make it use prettyprint (in case I've updated the config format, but not the function)

03:47:57 <@BoringUglyPinkEarthPony> I suppose you could code in an immunity to disconnect commands for 10 seconds after connection
do this by checking when you join a channel whether +H is set, if so, ignoring commands for 10 seconds?


standardise fullstops at the end of all hallo's messages.
add command format to all command help
standardise underscores or not in hallo commands and conf variables

make him quit with a different message for 'timeout' reconnect


05:36:03 < dr-spangle> -function config data? whether function is listed to users, ops, gods. disable functions, which module it is in, etc?


08:41:18 < dr-spangle> -more staff list stuff?
08:41:32 < dr-spangle> -make it so ops can be defined by channel, and their op powers can only modify those channels
08:48:55 < dr-spangle> -make functions disabled in privmsg and stuff, specifically stuff like 'is'
08:49:27 < dr-spangle> -make it so that any (non-command) message sent in privmsg to him is sent to admininform list
08:49:50 < dr-spangle> -admininform lists by channel, so channel swears only go to one channel's list
09:23:23 < dr-spangle> -could hallo somehow check irc flags for some permissions?

move swear detection to passive functions
