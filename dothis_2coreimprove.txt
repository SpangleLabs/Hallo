08:41:18 < dr-spangle> -more staff list stuff?
08:41:32 < dr-spangle> -make it so ops can be defined by channel, and their op powers can only modify those channels
08:49:50 < dr-spangle> -admininform lists by channel, so channel swears only go to one channel's list
09:23:23 < dr-spangle> -could hallo somehow check irc flags for some permissions?

move swear detection to passive functions

move a bunch of functions from ircbot.py to hallobase.py or something

ignore list by channel/server? ignore _S
