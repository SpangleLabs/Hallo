standardise fullstops at the end of all hallo's messages.
add command format to all command help
standardise underscores or not in hallo commands and conf variables

08:41:18 < dr-spangle> -more staff list stuff?
08:41:32 < dr-spangle> -make it so ops can be defined by channel, and their op powers can only modify those channels
08:49:50 < dr-spangle> -admininform lists by channel, so channel swears only go to one channel's list
09:23:23 < dr-spangle> -could hallo somehow check irc flags for some permissions?

move swear detection to passive functions

re add that megahal module, make it work beautifully.

make function names be listed with underscores, but accept a lack of underscores?

make hallo keep track of who is in a given channel, record nick changes and quits only in channels a user is in.

move base_function out of base_parse to a new thing.

check which import modules in each module are needed, remove those which are not. comment those which are saying where they are.
